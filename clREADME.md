Assumptions:

    Code size must be in range(0 to 1GB)


Limitations:

    Due to large file code may take large time to give output.


Implementation:

We performed unicode correction by having some if else statements on the 
natural unicode.

Syllable are extracted by  vowel sound ending.

precision=truepositive/(truepositive+falsepositive)

recall=truepositive/(truepositive+falsenegative)

F-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Q7(b)From your knowledge of language, mark the ones that are correct;
    => from the data of frequency itself we find that the string
     which are not suffix are having very less frequency 
     some of them which are not suffix are:['नों','र', 'क','व', 'से', 'नें']
